# SupplyChainSolidity

## Description
Supply chain is always hard to manage and requires a lot of admistrative machinery. However, when managed with smart contracts using blockchain, a lot of the paperwork is reduced.
Also it leads to an increase in the transparency and helps to build an efficient Root of Trust. Supply-chain-dapp is such an implementation of a supply chain management system which uses blockchain to ensure a transparent and secure transfer of product from the manufacturer to the customer via the online e-commerce websites. 

## Architecture
The smart contract is being written with Solidity which is then compiled, migrated and deployed using Truffle.js on the local blockchain network created using Ganache-cli.The frontend uses Web3.js to communicate with the smart contract and local blockchain network and is written using React.js framework for better component and state lifecycle management.The requests from user are forwarded to frontend through Nginx(load balancer) and Express.js for dynamic routing.

## Installation and Setup
Prerequisites : `npm, git, docker(optional)`

Clone the repository 
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/rishav4101/eth-supplychain-dapp.git && cd eth-supplychain-dapp
```
Install dependencies
```Bash
npm i
```
Install ganache-cli
```Bash
npm i -g ganache-cli
```
Configure ganache-cli for 10 accounts and extend gasLimit to 6721975000 and beyond, so as to have enough gas for migrating the smart contracts and a data flow for the prototype.  
```Bash
ganache-cli --accounts 10 --gasLimit 6721975000
```
If you want to run the ganache-cli on docker then use the following command
```Bash
sudo docker run -d -p 8545:8545 trufflesuite/ganache-cli:latest -h 0.0.0.0 --accounts 10 --gasLimit 6721975000
```
Migrate the contracts
```Bash
truffle migrate --network=develop --reset
```
Open a second terminal and enter the client folder
```Bash
cd client
```
Install all packages in the package.json file
```Bash
npm i
```
Setup an .env file using the `nano .env` command and enter the google maps api key and set the react rpc port to 8545 since the ganache-cli runs on the same port by default.
The final .env file must look like this
```Bash
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY=*************************
REACT_APP_RPC=http://127.0.0.1:8545/

```
Run the app
```Bash
npm start
```
The app gets hosted by default at port 3000.
